/**
 * Asset inventory — every raster/vector/video asset the site shows, with its
 * provenance. Check here before adding a visual: reuse beats a near-duplicate.
 *
 * Structure renders are drawn by IndiskaAI from Protein Data Bank coordinates
 * (PDB data is CC0 / public domain). The generator is `scripts/render-pdb.mjs`;
 * raw .pdb files are not committed. Interface residues are computed from the
 * deposited coordinates (any atom within 4.5 Å of the partner chain).
 * Motion inside the SVGs is illustrative, not simulated.
 *
 * Schematic SVG illustrations live in components/science/Illustrations.tsx and
 * are original; they are not listed here.
 *
 * public/pdb/{1HSG,1BRS,3HFM}.pdb are RCSB entries (CC0) trimmed by
 * scripts/trim-pdb.mjs. They feed the live 3D scenes in Docking → What we
 * analyse (components/docking), which compute pockets, interfaces and contact
 * distances from those coordinates.
