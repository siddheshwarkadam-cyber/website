/**
 * IndiskaAI's service lines. Shared by the Nav "Services" dropdown, the
 * /services hub page, and the /services/[slug] detail pages.
 *
 * Copy discipline (deliberate — please keep it):
 * - Pages are built SHOW → EXPLAIN → GUIDE. Every card, step, input and
 *   deliverable carries a glyph or illustration; text is one sentence.
 * - If a section looks empty, add a visual, not a paragraph.
 *
 * Accuracy notes (keep these in mind before editing copy):
 * - Everything here is computational. We do not run a wet lab, hold clinical
 *   accreditation, or issue diagnostic results — never imply otherwise, and
 *   never quote turnaround times or accuracy figures.
 * - Structure prediction yields candidate models; docking yields candidate
 *   poses; MD describes behaviour over a simulated trajectory. None of the
 *   three is experimental proof of binding. The hedging is deliberate.
 * - Story frames and analysis plots are schematic, never plotted from real
 *   runs, and are labelled as such in the UI.
 * - `videos` must only hold embeddable videos on their owner's channel with
 *   credit — see ExternalVideoCard.
